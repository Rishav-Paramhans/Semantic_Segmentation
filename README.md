# Setup
* ## Cuda and Python
In this Project I utilized Pytorch with Python 3.10, Cuda 11.6 and few other python libraries. However, feel free to try alternative versions or model of installation.

* ## Data
Download the full A2D2 dataset from the official Audi Dataset website. Training and Test Split of the data can be found in this repository as .CSV files under the name 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'.

* ## Training
Use the command: python train.py
The training progress can be monitored using Tensorboard. Writing the logs on the Tensorboard can be handled using hthe hypermeter WRITER in the training scripts.
